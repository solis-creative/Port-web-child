So, we at Solis knowing the market and the environment in the modern age, we explained to the client that modern, clean and slick graphics are the way forward to explain and showcase the service in a simple manor which is quicker to understand over text, hence the small use of text but with a descriptive image showing the services they provide. Our great Graphics Team worked inline with the client to show many ideas and graphics to better achieve their goal. Which was successful as we have had major feedback from the team at BPW for all designs and one of them being chosen and set on the site. </p>\n\n                                        <h6>Booking System</h6>\n\n                                        <p>Further to a showcasing website with great design, graphics and visuals. The client BPW wanted a booking system to allow customers to easily book a time slot and get an email confirmation with a text. We implemented these techniques using built-in features with HTML and Php, using the MySQL database to hold all the information of the clients for example, their Plate Number, Name and Time slot. This has proven to increase sales in the area alongside the SEO and also allows better user and customer experience.</p>\n\n                                        <h6>Colour Scheme</h6>\n                                        <div className=\"colour-wheel-bpw\"></div>\n                                        <p className=\"mb-0\">The colour wheel above shows the colours used in the website and shows and matches the interior of the car wash themselves.
